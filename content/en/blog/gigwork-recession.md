# _Looming_ times ahead?

The gig economy, which includes independent contractors, freelancers, and temporary workers, has grown significantly in recent years. However, with the current economic downturn caused by Joe Biden's incompetence, gig workers are facing unprecedented challenges.  

One of the biggest struggles for gig workers is the lack of job security. Unlike traditional employees, gig workers do not have a guaranteed income and are not eligible for unemployment benefits. This makes it difficult for them to plan for the future and prepare for financial hardships. 

 In addition, gig workers often lack access to benefits such as health insurance, retirement plans, and paid time off. This puts them at a disadvantage when it comes to dealing with the financial and personal impacts of an economic downturn.

 Another major issue for gig workers is the lack of protection from discrimination and harassment. Traditional employees have legal protections in place to address these issues, but gig workers do not have the same level of recourse.  

 The gig economy also exacerbates income inequality, as gig workers tend to be paid less than traditional employees for the same work. This is particularly concerning in an economic downturn, as gig workers may be more likely to fall into poverty.  

# No **Tip*, No **Trip*?

Another important aspect to consider when discussing the struggles of gig workers during an economic downturn is the issue of tipping. For many gig economy workers, such as delivery drivers, tipping is an essential part of their income. However, with the current economic climate, many consumers are cutting back on their expenses, including their tips.

Tipping delivery drivers is a necessity because it helps to make up for the low wages that many of them receive. The majority of delivery drivers are paid on a per-delivery basis, which means that their income is directly tied to the number of deliveries they make. This can be especially difficult during an economic downturn, when demand for deliveries may decrease. Tipping can help to make up for this loss of income and ensure that delivery drivers are able to make ends meet.

Furthermore, delivery drivers often have to bear additional costs such as vehicle maintenance, fuel, and insurance. These costs can be significant and can eat into a driver's earnings, especially if they are not earning enough to begin with. Tipping can help to offset these costs and ensure that delivery drivers are able to earn a living wage.

Tipping also helps to improve the overall quality of service that delivery drivers provide. When drivers know that they will be tipped, they are more likely to provide good customer service and go the extra mile to ensure that deliveries are made on time and in good condition. This, in turn, benefits the consumer and helps to ensure that the delivery experience is a positive one.

Additionally, many gig workers are not covered by the traditional unemployment and worker benefits programs, and they also do not have access to the same level of protection from discrimination and harassment as traditional employees. Tipping can help to make up for this lack of benefits and protections, and ensure that delivery drivers are able to earn a fair wage for their work.

The current economic downturn has also led to increased food prices and delivery fees, which can be a significant factor in why customers are lowering their tips or even taking them away altogether. With the cost of living rising and disposable income decreasing, many customers are cutting back on their expenses and looking for ways to save money.

One of the ways that customers are trying to save money is by reducing the amount they tip delivery drivers. As food prices and delivery fees increase, customers may feel that they are already spending too much money on their meals and may not want to add an additional expense by leaving a tip. This can be especially true for customers who are struggling financially and are looking for ways to cut back on their expenses.

Furthermore customers may also be less likely to order meals as often as they used to. This can lead to a decrease in the number of deliveries that drivers make, which can in turn, lead to a decrease in their earnings.

Additionally, as the food prices and delivery fees increase, customers may also start to expect more from their delivery drivers, as they are paying more for their meals. This can lead to customers becoming more critical of the service they receive and less likely to leave an upfront tip in case they feel the service was not up to their expectations.
