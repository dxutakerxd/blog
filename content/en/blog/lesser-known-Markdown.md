# Unlocking the Power of Lesser-Known Markdown Syntax

Markdown is a lightweight markup language that makes it easy to format text for the web. It's widely used in blogging, documentation, and even project management. But despite its simplicity, there are a few lesser-known features of Markdown that can help you take your writing to the next level. In this blog post, we'll explore some of these features and show you how to use them in your own writing.

## Table of Contents

1. [Task Lists](#task-lists)
2. [Strikethrough](#strikethrough)
3. [Tables](#tables)
4. [Mentions](#mentions)
5. [Emoji](#emoji)

## Task Lists

One of the most useful features of Markdown is the ability to create task lists. Task lists are great for creating to-do lists or checklists within your writing. To create a task list, simply add a `- [ ]` before each item on your list. For example:

```markdown
- [ ] Write a blog post about Markdown
- [ ] Research lesser-known Markdown syntax
- [ ] Create examples for each feature
- [ ] Publish the post

You can also use - [x] to indicate a completed task.

- [x] Write a blog post about Markdown
- [x] Research lesser-known Markdown syntax
- [x] Create examples for each feature
- [ ] Publish the post

`const hello = "Hello, World!";
console.log(hello);`
