## About Me

My name is **Tex Murphy** and I am a professional in the field of **Web Development**. With over 5 years of experience, I have a strong background in both front-end and back-end development. My expertise lies in creating responsive and user-friendly websites and applications using the latest technologies and best practices.

I am highly skilled in the following languages and technologies:

- HTML, CSS, JavaScript
- React, Vue.js
- Node.js, Express
- MongoDB, MySQL
- Git

In addition to my technical skills, I am also a strong communicator and team player. I have experience working in agile development environments and am comfortable collaborating with designers, project managers, and other developers to deliver high-quality projects on time and on budget.

When I'm not coding, you can find me reading about new technologies, experimenting with new development tools, and practicing my photography skills.

If you're interested in working together or just want to chat about tech, feel free to reach out to me via email at `Fakemail101@protonmail.com` or connect with me on [Youtube](https://www.youtube.com/@dxutakerxd).
